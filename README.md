## 🚀 About This Portfolio  

Welcome to my structured Data Science & Data Engineering portfolio — a journey that combines **clarity, skill-building, and transformation**.  
Each folder here reflects one domain I’m mastering — from Python and SQL foundations to ML, AWS, and end-to-end projects.  

🧭 **Roadmap Goal:**  
Become *interview-ready and job-switch prepared* — building confidence through consistent, documented progress.  

📅 **Target Deadline:** October 15, 2025 (Stage 1: Foundations)
